title: Minecraft 1.12.1 released

We're all working very hard on 1.13, which will be a technical update to make the game run better than ever & easier for us to add super cool things later. But for now, we decided to create a small bugfix release for a multiplayer security issue in 1.12.<br>

**Changes in 1.12.1:**<br>
\* Made some optimisations<br>
\* Updated game credits (Click on the copyright info on the title screen!)<br>
\* Fixed bug MC-86016 - Some Mojang staff not mentioned in credits.txt<br>
\* Fixed private bug MC-119011 - Security issue with recipe book<br>
