title: Minecraft 1.14 - Village & Pillage
---

Apparently, it takes a village to raise a child. Frankly, if we'd known how much work putting together the biggest Minecraft update yet was going to be, we'd have probably taken the easy option and tried to raise that child instead.<br>

But it was all worth it for this, **Village & Pillage** Update release day! I can almost hear the Pillagers firing their crossbows into the air in celebration! Or are they firing them towards me...<br>
