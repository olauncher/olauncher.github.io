title: Minecraft 1.16 - Nether Update
---

One does not simply walk into the Nether, but it seems that's what everyone is about to do anyway...<br>

Today we're releasing the full Nether Update in all its glory! Traverse through familiar, fiery wastes into new unexplored fungal forests, spooky valleys, and deltas brimming with basalt.<br>

Dig your way through these biomes and you might be able to find a new curious material, suspiciously titled "ancient debris". What will you make of it (it&rsquo;s totally not Netherite)?<br>

Fight your way through hordes of Piglins&hellip; Or don't! They&rsquo;re actually pretty cool if you bring some bling. And in case you find yourself in the wrong end of a bargain, make sure that you have access to a functional respawn anchor.<br>

I advise you to not use your regular bed unless you&rsquo;re feeling a bit&hellip; &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo;.<br>

Enjoy the update!<br>
