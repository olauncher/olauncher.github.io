title: Update Aquatic is out on Java!
---
The tide is coming in at last! That's sea-faring speak for 'Java Players! Today you get the full Update Aquatic!'<br>

There's a whole new ocean of features, impatiently waiting for you to dive in! Take a delightful swim with dolphins and tropical fish. Explore mysterious ruins and tragic shipwrecks while hunting for new deep-sea treasures. Meet turtles on the shore and defend their eggs from mobs with the new trident!<br>

Trust us, you'll want that new weapon. Because our biggest ocean update ever has also made these seas much more dangerous places to explore. Get too distracted by the colourful coral, and you might get dragged down to the ocean floor by bubble columns. Which could result in introducing yourself to the Drowned. What are the Drowned? Why not swim down to the ocean floor and find out? After you!<br>

Still, at least you're safe on land! Well, as long as you get enough sleep. Otherwise, you might meet The Phantom, the mob you voted into Minecraft last year. Be careful what you wish for, and enjoy the update!<br>
